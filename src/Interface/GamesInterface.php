/**
 * Games
 *
 * Your bot can offer users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete
 * against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Create games via
 * @BotFather using the /newgame command. Please note that this kind of
 * power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for
 * each game that your bots will be offering.
 *
 * Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game
 * and InlineQueryResultGame objects.
 * Once you've created a game via BotFather, you can send games to chats
 * as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with
 * InlineQueryResultGame.
 * If you send the game message without any buttons, it will
 * automatically have a 'Play GameName' button. When this button is
 * pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the game_short_name of the
 * requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user
 * and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.
 * You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please
 * note that the first button in the first row must always launch the
 * game, using the field callback_game in InlineKeyboardButton. You can
 * add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the
 * rules, or to open the game's official community.
 * To make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that
 * demostrates the game to the users via BotFather (see Lumberjack for
 * example).
 * A game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use
 * setGameScore to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the
 * edit_message parameter to automatically update the message with the
 * current scoreboard.
 * Use getGameHighScores to get data for in-game high score tables.
 * You can also add an extra sharing button for users to share their best
 * score to different chats.
 * For examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the
 * @gamebot and @gamee bots.
