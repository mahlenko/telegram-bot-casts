 * Use this method to unban a previously banned user in a supergroup or
 * channel. The user will not return to the group or channel
 * automatically, but will be able to join via link, etc. The bot must be
 * an administrator for this to work. By default, this method guarantees
 * that after the call the user is not a member of the chat, but will be
 * able to join it. So if the user is a member of the chat they will also
 * be removed from the chat. If you don't want this, use the parameter
 * only_if_banned. Returns True on success.
