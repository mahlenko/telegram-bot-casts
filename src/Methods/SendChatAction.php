/**
 * Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is
 * happening on the bot's side. The status is set for 5 seconds or less
 * (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its
 * typing status). Returns True on success.
 *
 * Example: The ImageBot needs some time to process a request and upload
 * the image. Instead of sending a text message along the lines of
 * “Retrieving image, please wait…”, the bot may use sendChatAction
 * with action = upload_photo. The user will see a “sending photo”
 * status for the bot.
 *
 * We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will
 * take a noticeable amount of time to arrive.
