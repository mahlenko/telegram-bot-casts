 * Informs a user that some of the Telegram Passport elements they
 * provided contains errors. The user will not be able to re-submit their
 * Passport to you until the errors are fixed (the contents of the field
 * for which you returned the error must change). Returns True on
 * success.
 * Use this if the data submitted by the user doesn't satisfy the
 * standards your service requires for any reason. For example, if a
 * birthday date seems invalid, a submitted document is blurry, a scan
 * shows evidence of tampering, etc. Supply some details in the error
 * message to make sure the user knows how to correct the issues.
